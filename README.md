# Project-3-Networks-Data-Communications

Overview:
-
- Special Encoding Scheme 
  1) Takes an integer between -121 and 121 (non-zero).
  2) Encodes it using coefficients of powers of 3: (81, 27, 9, 3, 1).
  3) Coefficients can be -1, 0, or 1.
  4) Uses client-server socket communication.
  5) The server sends the encoded 5-element tuple back to the client"

-How to run program:
-
1) Open terminal, and type in "python client_gui.py".
2) Once you do that, a window will pop up.
3) Next open another terminal in the same one, and type in "python server.py".
4) Go back to the window that popped up, type in any integer, then click enter and a small window will pop up with the encoded element.
